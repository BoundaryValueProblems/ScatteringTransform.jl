# ScatteringTransform.jl
An implementation of the generalized scattering transform in Julia. Documentation in progress, as are updates to 1.0

## Installation
Basic installation: at the moment, this is not an official package. Because of this, to install it, you must first clone it, then make it accessible to your project. In 0.7 onwards, do `git clone`
```
  (v0.7) pkg> activate .
  (ScatteringTransform) pkg> instantiate
```
At the top of your project, add `using Pkg; Pkg.activate("~/.julia/dev/ScatteringTransform.jl")`.
